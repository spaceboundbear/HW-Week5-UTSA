This app is a simple daily scheduler to manage a standard work day. It keeps track of your time and will change color based on the time of day. You can save your schedule and clear it as well. 

1. First upload:
    Code was very long and repetetive with an individual function for each time slot. It made viewing the code difficult. Couldn't figure out coloring for each timeslot
    
2. Second upload: 
    Changed all functions using (this) instead of setting individual functions for time slots. Color now updates with timeslots
